                  <h2>Meet Janice, Spider Savior!</h2>
                  <p>
                  Itsy was a spider hero. He cleans rain gutters for a homeless shelter. He was dedicated to helping Portland's most unfortunate. During our latest rainstorm, a burst of water came down the spout and washed pour Itsy out. He suffered serious injuries and was not able to climb up the spout again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Itsy, permanently disabled, needed a home. Many people hate spiders and are not willing to take care of them. Itsy was suffering from spider discrimination.
                  </p>
                  <p>Via Spider Saviors, Janice graciously volunteered to be Itsy's hero and foster him. Spider Saviors helped Itsy find a loving home, where he will be taken care of by Janice. Janice is a Spider Savior!</p>
